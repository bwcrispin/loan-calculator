# loan-calculator

A vanilla JS loan calculator with a fun spinning .gif.  If information is left out to perform the calculations, then an error message will be displayed.

For running the program, I have used VSCode to open the folder and run through Live Server. You can also download the folder, go into your browser, and choose Open File and select the index.html file in the Tasklist folder you have downloaded.
